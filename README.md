# Poker Game Dealer

## Description
This is a optional project in Introduction to Programming subject in HCMUS, doing it only get plus marks.  
This project helps you have an overview look at (static) array in C/C++. It is actually a simple console program which automatically generates a random possibility for each player.
So, maybe it is considered as a testing program for my own algorithm about processing dealing, calculating points and ranking (because it happens linearly, run-and-exit).

## Prerequisites
It is pretty simple to understand and follow this source code, but there is a weakness which I have caused, that is very-few-or-no comments for fragment code.  
You just need to know very little about Introduction to Programming, is enough.  
You have to have an IDE, such as DevC++ or Microsoft Visual Studio, or g++ with a raw text editor like Notepad (it must be very pro).

## Usage
Clone or download this repository, create a project, then add all files (header and source code files) to your project. Run or debug each line to undestand deeply.

## Authorization
Allow people to share this source code as a reference resource. Anyone mustn't use this for trade purposes.
